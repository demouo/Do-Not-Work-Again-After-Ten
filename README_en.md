Starting from June 8, 2024, I saw a story about the sudden death of a NetEase employee on Xiaohongshu. He is me, and I am him. We are always indifferent and indifferent to the passing of others, until it happens to ourselves. I don't see any hope, I only know that getting enough sleep every day is difficult. I used to hear that many sudden deaths are just a result of anger. Today, I want to do something, perhaps it is a very small stone falling into the water, which can cause as many splashes as it can.

I'm not sure what I can do, I think I can only record these abnormal deaths

These are not my talk points, but a reminder that there is an 80% chance that they will be our future.

However, compared with other Internet companies, Shopee's working environment is relatively good. |
